All-Time(s) Search is the culmination of my progression through Thinkful's Front-End Web Development Career Path Program.  The project is built on Google's AngularJS JavaScript framework, and utilizes CSS Flexbox to generate a virtual newspaper feel.  Built-in JavaScript math functions are used to randomize the flexbox layout with each search, so the user gets a truly unique experience with each and every search.  The New York Times articles API is used to search for and deliver all data, and contains information dating all the way back to the newspaper's beginning on September 18, 1851.  

A live version of the project can be found here: bpcoxjr.github.io/times-search/app.
